        "The Wilson activity coefficient model is a semi-empirical model used to describe the non-ideal behavior of liquid mixtures. It is based on the assumption that the excess Gibbs free energy of mixing is due to the different sizes and interactions of the molecules in the mixture. The Wilson model has been shown to be accurate for a wide range of mixtures, including ethanol-cyclohexane.\n",
