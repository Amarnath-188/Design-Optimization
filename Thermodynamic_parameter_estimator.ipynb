It is based on the assumption that the excess Gibbs free energy of mixing is due to the different sizes and interactions of the molecules in the mixture. The Wilson model has been shown to be accurate for a wide range of mixtures, including ethanol-cyclohexane.\n",

Here, the system consists of two phases (liquid and vapor) and two components (ethanol and cyclohexane), resulting in two degrees of freedom that require specification. In this scenario, a choice must be made to constrain two out of the four measured values for the system, involving x1, y1, P, or T. It is advisable to constrain the values of x1 and P, as demonstrated in the tutorial below."
